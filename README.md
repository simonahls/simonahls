# 👋 Hi, I’m Simon Ahlström

I'm an **embedded systems engineer** and **maker** based in Sweden — passionate about low-level programming, hardware integration, and turning ideas into working prototypes.  
Most of my projects mix **C/C++**, **Python**, and **electronics**, ranging from ESP32-based displays and motor control to Python tools, Tkinter GUIs, and game-inspired utilities.

---

### ⚙️ What I do
- Work with **embedded software**, hardware bring-up, and debugging (CAN, I2C, SPI, UART, FreeRTOS)
- Design tools for **automation**, **data parsing**, and **visualization**
- Experiment with **UI prototyping** (Tkinter, Raylib, Power BI dashboards)
- Build small games and creative utilities like **D&D character generators** and **interactive story apps**

---

### 🌱 Currently learning
- **Advanced C/C++ for embedded systems**
- **RTOS internals & driver design**
- **Modern Python patterns** (async, GUI structuring, modularity)
- **Git** workflows and CI/CD for personal projects

---

### 🧠 What drives me
I love bridging hardware and software — taking a circuit, a display, or a signal trace and making it *do something useful and elegant*.  
Whether it's a vehicle ECU log parser, a Tkinter-based automation tool, or a home-lab monitoring script, I enjoy designing things that are both **technical and human-friendly**.

### 💞️ I’m open to collaborate on
- Embedded utilities, simulators, or hardware-in-loop tools  
- Home automation / maker electronics  
- D&D or game-related creative software ideas
